You were only supposed to write the markup for the web page.Tags like <font> were introduced in HTML version 3.2, and it caused quite a lot of trouble for web developers. Due to the fact that web pages have different fonts, colored backgrounds, and multiple styles, it was a long, painful, and expensive process to rewrite the code. Thus, CSS was created by W3C to solve this problem.",
